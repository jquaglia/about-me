## About Me

I built a website with a guessing game built in. My guessing game asks you questions about myself so you can learn more about me. The guessing game asks you yes or no questions and has responses for both answers. I tried to personalize it as much as possible so it would seem interactive. I have also added bio/background to who I am and what I am doing here on the actual site. Please take the time to learn more about who I am and visit my site!
