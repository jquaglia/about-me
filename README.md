## About Me

I built a website with a guessing game built in. My guessing game asks you questions about myself so you can learn more about me. The guessing game asks you yes or no questions and has responses for both answers. I tried to personalize it as much as possible so it would seem interactive. I have also added bio/background to who I am and what I am doing here on the actual site. Please take the time to learn more about who I am and visit my site!

### Reflections and Comments

* I need to be more aware of time management and not let the black hole that is CSS take a hold of me.

* Stack Exchange appears to be getting easier and easier to understand and I'm learning from the things that aren't even relevant.

* I'm now reflecting upon the reflection. I thought the journal was going to be somewhat annoying but after all the technical stuff, it has been cathartic.

* Loops are hard. It's easy to get completely lost in the brackets.

* I wasn't sure on proper syntax for the logic i needed to finish a while loop. After seeing code review on 12/3 I used the syntax that was used in class to get working code.
