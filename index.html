            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p class="first-paragraph">
                Hello, my name is Jason Quaglia and I'm a 26 year old student at CodeFellows. I currently live in downtown Seattle with my girlfriend Katie and our dog Bentley. I'm and avid lover of technology and I love to tinker with electronics. I like to build computers and even build my own mechanical keyboards. I also love to go outside and hike, camp and snowboard! I also want to go foraging for food as I've been learning about that on youtube. I grew up in upstate New York and after a year of college, decided it wasn't right for me at the time. I decided to move to Truckee, California where my first real job experience started. I got a job at a ski resort right away as a ski lift operator. I spent a couple years bouncing around the seasonal resort jobs before I found a full time job as a security guard for a gated community. I spent 3 years doing that until Katie and I decided to change things up and move to Seattle in hopes of better career choices and new scenery. After about a year as a security guard, the COVID pandemic hit and I decided now was the best time to pivot and train for a new career.

            <h2>Goals!</h2>
            <p class="second-paragraph">
                My first and foremost goal is to obtain gainful employment. I wish to do this to better my life and to help better the lives of friends and family around me. I also want work that is flexible and resistant towards recession. As we have seen with the pandemic the tech industry has been one of the most resiliant industries. I also want to use that flexibility to travel and live in new places. I want to meet new people and cultures (and eat their food). I also have some ideas for tools that I think could be used in this new work from home era. I would love to see if any of them come to fruition.
